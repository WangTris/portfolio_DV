              "Hey VÃ¢n, I've been with you since those first days of your
              channel. It was your little tips and your approach to learning
              IELTS that sparked my own drive to reach my desired IELTS score.
              Can you believe it's already been two years? Your videos have
              always been a beacon of inspiration for me, especially as I
              started navigating university life (we're the same age, though I'm
              studying here in Vietnam). I get it, you're going through a big
              transition and feeling a bit lost right now. But you know what? I
              see you like a blank canvas, or a map yet to be drawn. It's a bit
              daunting, sure. Feeling lost is part of the journey ðŸ˜¯. But think
              of it this way - with a blank canvas, you've got the freedom to
              create any path you choose. It's all up to you. Everything's wide
              open, and the possibilities are limitless. Isn't that just
              amazing? Believe in yourself, VÃ¢n, and embrace life with all
              you've got ðŸ˜Š.{" "}
